This workshop is inspired by the project of European communication entitled Finestra sull'Europa, which is an experimental program developed at the University of Perugia and La Sapienza University in Rome, based on the involvement of the students in educational publishing activities intended to create journalistic products entirely dedicated to the European Union. During the workshop, the issue of European information and communication will be discussed through a comparison of best practices, useful to refine the techniques of communication of complex content such as that related to the EU. The positive effects, in terms of training possibilities, of a similar communication activity within a university career will also be analyzed.

The panel will consider the case of the Umbrian regional newspaper Il Giornale dell’Umbria: the recent transfer of ownership, the collapse in copies sold due to controversial editorial choices, the lack of trust in the editor, the endless series of strikes and the final winding-up of the company which resulted in the recent sacking of about thirty people (both journalists and polygraph specialists).
Both the company history and the personal/professional paths of its journalists will be discussed in an attempt to highlight all the limits and opportunities (if any) of local newspaper publishing nowadays.

			<descrizione><![CDATA[
The protection of sources is one of the foundations of a journalist’s work. Not surprisingly, it is the law itself that establishes a legal protection so that the journalist is allowed not to disclose his sources, even if he is on trial. Maintaining the delicate balance between freedom of the press and the need for justice, however, requires legal assessments and technical skills so as to avoid compromising any such fundamental rights. We will try, therefore, to outline the ideal process to achieve this balance, taking into account important laws, precedents and the most effective technical tools to use.
Organized in association with the Department of Legal Informatics of the University of Milan.

Sometimes we find the data we need only to realise they are scattered across dozens or hundreds of Excel reports, divided by year, month etc. They have the same structure, they're could be even nice for a human being to read, but they're the worst to anything with data analysis applications. A copy paste nightmare awaits anyone who wants to create one clean and nice spreadsheet with the consolidated data. This hands-on session will teach beginners in Python how to write a simple script that will extract the information from the Excel files and join them together in one CSV for further analysis.
This session is good for: Journalists who can do a little bit of programming and want to sharpen their skills.
What you need to know: a little bit of Python, will go slower for beginners.

Genetically modified crops, also called transgenic plants or GMO, have been in existence for over thirty years and have been used in agriculture for more than twenty years. They now represent more than 12% of the land cultivated globally and they are one of the main topics of media discussion about agriculture. Despite the extensive media coverage, however, opinions on this subject seem to be based more on political and ideological elements than on knowledge of the crops themselves and of the motivations that lead to scientists producing them and to farmers growing them. In this session the world of science and the world of media will try to clear the air.

According to a study by Forrester Research, a one-minute video has the same communication effectiveness as about 1.8 million words. Cisco has estimated that by 2019 Internet will be inundated with about a million minutes of video content per second, 79% of global data traffic. It is not a coincidence that today the most shared content on social media are multimedia, videos and photos. From thirty seconds to a few minutes, the video is capturing the interest of large global networks. The session will provide an overview of the most effective projects and what can we learn by doing this world tour.

The session will take as its starting point a report written by the Perugia Journalism School on this phenomenon, which has exploded over the last 15 years and continues unabated.

The research project Less Hate, More Speech implements a field experiment in comment moderation on major mainstream media sites in Romania. The media partners are Gsp.ro – one of the biggest news websites in Romania with over 3m unique visitors per month, and the third most widely read newspaper offline – and Tolo.ro, which is the blog of its chief editor, a top investigative journalist in Romania.
The main goal of Less Hate, More Speech is to understand the narratives and frames that might make people find the better angels in themselves, i.e. make them stop expressing, acting, talking in prejudiced, intolerant, discriminatory and uncivil ways in the public domain.
The focus of this session will be on the first findings after almost a year of implementing the moderation system, on it's impact and emerging trends, on user behavior and results from online experiments.

When award winning OCCRP journalist Khadija Ismayilova was arrested in Azerbaijan in December 2014, she asked her colleagues to finish her work. Under OCCRP’s direction, more than two dozen reporters from a dozen media spent the past year looking at issues she had been working on at the time of her arrest and issues she had cared about. The government wanted to shut her down, but instead they got the army of reporters. The Khadija Project represents the work Khadija would likely have done had she not been arrested.
Reporters uncovered a huge bribe with which President Ilham Aliyev's family apparently took over a government stake in Azerbaijan's largest mobile operator, worth about $1 billion. They also discovered that members of the Aliyev family and their close advisers control more than $3 billion in at least eight major Azerbaijan banks. OCCRP also found that the Aliyevs own at least one third of the five star hotels in Baku -- many built for the European Games hosted in Baku. Reporters also found a mansion and luxury apartments in London, a Moscow Dacha and two luxury yachts all owned or used by the family.

Independent high-quality journalism is struggling to find sources of funding - so alternative sources like governments, private companies, non-state actors and the public invest into media. But is that a good thing only? What do the various sources of funding imply and what are the pitfalls? The aim of this session is to reflect more deeply about different levels of scope, objectives, bias, engagement and motivation for media in the current context. A debate with the attendees will follow.
Organised in association with the Global Forum for Media Development.

Sports journalism is changing very rapidly. Twenty years ago, radio and print media played the starring role in journalism. Then there was the era of television. Still, the future - actually, the present - seems to belong to the Internet, to websites and social networks. What about “old media”? Are they going to survive the change? What are the reasons for and the features of the success of online media? What instruments are required to take on these new challenges.

On the thirtieth anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, a preview of The Russian Woodpecker, the movie directed by Chad Gracia which won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance in 2015.
What if it was not just an accident? I Wonder Pictures presents a preview of The Russian Woodpecker, 30 years after the explosion of the reactor at Chernobyl, which casts a new light on the origins and reasons behind the disaster.
Presented for the first preview in Italy at Biografilm 2015, where it won the Hera Prize for "New Talents" for the best first film, The Russian Woodpecker will be distributed in Italian cinemas by I Wonder Pictures starting from 7 April.
Thirty years ago, the Chernobyl incident aroused worldwide attention to the risks of nuclear energy. Today it is still the only major nuclear disaster officially recognized as caused by human error. But what if it was not caused by a mistake?
In 1986 Fedor was only four years old. When he starts to investigate the catastrophe, he discovers the Duga, a giant antenna that was supposed to interfere with western communications and infiltrate them with Soviet propaganda. A structure that has never worked and that, perhaps, is no stranger to the reactor burst... In the midst of the Ukrainian revolution, Fedor brings to light a dangerous truth for himself and those around him, in a political thriller punctuated by the disturbing and cadenced noise of the threatening Duga, similar in every way to that of a big woodpecker.
Admission to the preview is free and organized in association with I Wonder Pictures, the International Journalism Festival and Cinema Postmodernissimo of Perugia.

			<descrizione><![CDATA[
The theatre of objects is a tale of world history through objects, a narrative based on showing things, certain that even the most modest memento, say an advertising ashtray, may lead to a story or even contribute to an epic starting point.
The actors here are in effect things without a rigid reference text, things merely offered to the attention of the audience by the narrator and commented on in a sequence that creates a perfect visual novel, the novel of things.
What things, what objects? For example the board game that Groucho Marx designed for the NBC television station in the fifties, the little man of the detergent who was miraculously smoking his cigarettes, the mechanical race-course with its horses in Bakelite, the votive image of the saint of the poor of Peru that makes thieves invisible, the pennant of the Rotary Club in Hiroshima, the banknote issued by Spanish anarchists in 1936, the pencil sharpener in the shape of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the business cards of the past, the money-box shaped as a little house of the INA-CASA, the ring made by the Vietnamese people with the metal of downed American bombers, the manifesto to find Emanuela Orlandi, the flag of the Paris Municipality, the flags of the Italian Communist Party, the poster for police recruitment, the Buffalo Bill music score by De Gregori, the legendary plastic book of Roberto D'Agostino ... and objects that speak specifically of journalism itself.
With Gerardo Balestrieri on the accordion.

Today we live in a world based on data: information is key to cultural, economic and social processes. The growth of digital information and our increased ability to access it have triggered a change in our way of managing knowledge, for we are no longer just passively consuming information but are also actively creating, reusing and sharing it.
The session will examine the extent and the limits of the right to know in respect of public sector information, which consists of a gold mine of data. For this purpose the privileged objects of analysis will be the right of access to data of public administrations and the use of open government data. How wide is freedom of information towards institutions? What tools can we use to know government data? How can we use open data for articles, stories, surveys? These are some questions which we will try to provide a response to, by analysis of the legal possibilities that the current law allows with respect to public sector information.
Organized in association with the Department of Legal Informatics of the University of Milan.

GlobalStat.eu is a data repository which collects country-level data for 193 UN countries for the longest period available, starting in 1960. With its ‘3-click to data’ approach, GlobalStat facilitates the search for, access to and use of data collected from various bodies and international statistical sources. Additionally, the website allows for multiple forms of data visualisations. Tables, rankings, bar and line charts offer different graphical representations of the indicators chosen. Filters by period (selection of years) and by groups (selecting countries, continents and/or other entities) are available for targeted in-depth analysis. All data and metadata are accessible free of charge.
GlobalStat is developed by the European University Institute and the Fundação Francisco Manuel dos Santos.
The proposed workshop will present the GlobalStat database as an easy-to-use, updated and reliable source of international statistics and data. During the workshop the GlobalStat team will train journalists on an effective use of different types of charts and of international comparisons across countries and continents on specific topics. The main goal is to teach how to get the correct information in the clearest format and how to connect numbers to stories. The workshop will also offer the opportunity to discuss the urgency, benefits and pitfalls of contemporary data journalism.
Workshop structure: Introduction to GlobalStat’s content and structure; Examples of infographics and statistical data use in Italian/ International newspapers’ websites and paper versions (for example: Data Blog of Corriere della Sera, Pagina99 Infographics, Openpolis/Openblog.it, Pordata.pt etc.); Hands-on training on harvesting the GlobalStat data repository with simple tools.

Journalism ethics for everyone: Italy, the USA, and a tool for a do-it-yourself code.
The difference between journalism and other forms of communication is its ethics, whatever laws and regulations dictate or allow.

We will show and discuss it, comparing the American and Italian professional cultures. The DIY Ethical Code project was launched two years ago at ijf14 in Perugia.

Making secondary trauma a primary issue: understanding the impact of vicarious trauma in newsrooms.
A growing number of journalists who regularly handle images and videos sourced from the social web are displaying symptoms of trauma previously only associated with foreign correspondents, (those who had witnessed death and destruction firsthand). This panel will discuss new research that has examined journalists’ personal experiences of working with this type of content and offers a starting point for understanding the scale of the issue in the industry today. It will also highlight ways some newsrooms have raised awareness of vicarious trauma and created supportive cultures where journalists feel comfortable  seeking help when necessary. If you do work with this type of content, there will also be tips for how to minimize the potential impact.
Organised in association with the First Draft News Coalition.

The purpose of this masterclass is to provide journalists as well as journalism students with the know-how to use Twitter and Periscope for their daily work. The participants will be walked through the Twitter ecosystem and will discover how to successfully use this social media platform to research, curate and spread information in real-time and without any barriers. There will be special focus on Periscope, the 1-year-old app representing the ultimate frontier of live reporting.
Organised and sponsored by Twitter.
Please note that this session will be the same as the Twitter masterclass on Wednesday 06 April at 14.00, due to the fact it forms part of the formal training programme run by the Italian National Association of Journalists.

In this workshop, the necessary measures to ensure the privacy of sources and the confidentiality of gathered information, reviewing all relevant aspects involved in the reporting process with particular reference to physical, logical and organizational security aspects, will be illustrated. The current legislative framework, in the light of the recent proposals of law on whistleblowing, will also be analyzed, in order to evaluate adherence to best practices in the field, the incentive effect on the sources and the ability to convey anonymous reporting through systems that provide a real "technological anonymity."
Organized in association with the Department of Legal Informatics of the University of Milan.

In the times of Twitter, what does talking about literature mean? Who are the people that can make an influence? How can we say a lot with only 140 characters? Twitter has become the most simple and immediate way to talk about books and, especially, to promote them. It is a way to have a direct contact with the public, in particular for authors with their readers.

Grants have become an indispensable funding source for journalism. However, applying for a grant is a rocky road, and it requires thinking and writing in a manner that is, forgivably, alien to many journalists and news organisations. This talk will highlight nine common mistakes made in journalism grant applications across the board - from small-time stipends to the real whoppers. By avoiding those mistakes, applicants will make it more easily on the shortlist - or realise why they better not submit in the first place.

Stephan Weichert will give an insight into his study which examined actions on all of the four journalistic levels (research, production, publishing and user interaction) that are adopted by technical systems automatically – either half or fully. “Robot journalism” is largely understood as algorithmic activity used in the journalistic field of fact-based reporting like news coverage about sport results and the stock market. However, his paper claims that certain “robotic trends” can also be found in the processes of digital production and distribution through the explicit use of technical aids, e.g. programs and software applications, that observe, search and assess on different states of action and also in varying degrees of intensity.
Frederik Fischer will talk about how the perception of automation in the newsrooms shifted since the founding of Tame in 2012.
The objectives of the session include the following:
&gt; Recommend automation tools that help journalists with their day-to-day tasks.
&gt; Learn from the attendees the differences in the use of automation tools across newsrooms and countries.

In January 2016, the Italian Council of Ministers approved the preliminary draft of the decree on access to data and documents of public administrations, in accordance with the Public Administration Reform (Law no. 124/2015 – the so-called “Madia law”). The text should become the Italian Freedom of Information Act, which will rule the access to information, essential for investigative journalism, founded on international standards already adopted and tested.
In this session, there will be a brief analysis of FOIA and the state of the Italian legislation, highlighting the main problems and providing some clarification in relation to investigative journalism.
Organized in association with the Department of Legal Informatics of the University of Milan.

The refugee crisis that has engulfed the European Union for over a year now is a classic example of a complex humanitarian emergency. Caused primarily by the civil war in Syria and, to a lesser extent, political instability in Africa, it has human, political, security, and economic dimensions which in turn have repercussions for the transit and recipient states, their relations with one another, and above all for the people affected. Understanding and responsibly reporting rather than sensationalising the refugee crisis poses complex challenges and requires both a detailed grasp of its different dimensions and a big picture view. This panel brings together experts with a range of experience and perspectives in complex humanitarian emergencies to offer nuanced, balanced, and in-depth analysis.

Thanks to social media everyone can have an opinion and a voice, but should journalists get personal too? Emotional imagery and words are a great way to get traffic on social media or to get an audience to pay attention, but shouldn't the news be balanced and factual? Or is better for journalists to wear their hearts on their sleeves and to be honest about their views?
The session will take as its starting point some of the issues raised in the article How journalism is turning emotional by Charlie Beckett.

Hacking the newsroom. How hackers and journalists are working together to change the shape of journalism to come.
Hackers, coders and programmers are more and more frequently embedded in journalistic routines. They work closely with journalists and reporters to create tools, analyze data or design user interfaces. The aim of the panel is to bring together best practices, case studies and ideas about how the journalistic and hacking cultures are overlapping.
The panellists are hackers or journalists coming from different backgrounds (digital security, data journalism, design) and different media (large media companies, independent groups) and journalistic cultures. During the session they will present some of their recent projects and share their experience in working in collaborative and multidisciplinary environments.

How to identify the best sources for a difficult investigation. Then how to get even unwilling sources to co-operate. The best sources are often people with something to hide. But how do you convince people who are sworn to secrecy to assist your investigation? An award-winning investigative journalist discusses his strategy for breaking the ice in difficult investigations.

We live in a golden age of television, but not of television news. Television entertainment thrives “beyond the box” on an internet that has embraced video and where we see the rise of on-demand viewing, distributed viewing, and mobile viewing. But television news is struggling to find its place in this new environment, and is increasingly serving a shrinking number of older viewers while losing touch with younger generations who have grown up with digital media. In this panel, we discuss what is happening to television news as live linear scheduled becomes a relatively less important part of the overall media environment, various forms of online video become more important, and as news providers include broadcasters, newspapers, and as new pure players experiment with various forms of online video news.
Organised in association with the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, University of Oxford.

According to a recent report published by the World Health Organization, sex education at school promotes a decrease in unprotected sex, in sexually transmitted diseases and in teenage pregnancies. Yet, as will be clear from this session, in Italy talking about sexuality and feelings to children of school age is still a taboo due to the opposition of the Catholic Church and some associations and political groups. Propaganda spreads false information on the "gender danger" and the fear that sex education is a tool to destroy the identity of young people. What can be done about this?

The attacks against investigative journalism in Italy have not been coming just from death threats. Reckless complaints, unjustified seizures, deficient and inadequate laws, claims for compensation, the risk and the duty to protect the sources, the lack of protection for temporary and freelance workers have became the enemy of journalists who want to report on unpublished information. Stories and resistance of reporters who investigate the facts.

In the beginning there was gonzo journalism, with the desecrating irruption of the not-neutral-at-all first person onto the journalistic scene. Then, with the advent of the web and digital reality came new forms of participatory narrative rooted in the journalism landscape, more and more marked by subjectivity and interactivity. Regardless of whether it is called deep journalism, niche reporting or immersive journalism, the goal is the same: to create forms of narrative that knock down the barriers between those who produce and those who consume news, focusing on empathy that new technologies are driving and, in some ways, dictating.
This workshop will include the presentation of extracts from the most interesting experiments of the various above-mentioned narrative currents.

Every year Italians work until 5 February only to finance waste and inefficiencies of the state. On this symbolic date, identified by the newsroom of Sky TG24, there is the whole sense of the gravity of the economic damage caused by the bad management of public resources. It is a deeply rooted problem in Italy, the result of   inefficiency and bureaucracy, but also of bribery and corruption, which places a further brake on the growth of the country, at a time when a prudent and efficient use of  funds could represent an important driving force for the revitalization of the economy. Waste of public money is a phenomenon repeatedly reported by many (the media, the Court of Auditors and trade associations) for which there have been attempts to take action, through targeted government expenditure cuts, efficiency processes and monitoring activities, such as the register of unfinished works. Unfortunately, there is still a lot to be done.

It is estimated that each year up to 2,000 billion dollars are recycled, much of it through companies that allow the identity of the beneficiaries of the money to be kept secret. Tracking financial flows - especially those with illegal origin - is becoming increasingly complex. As if "classic" tax havens were not enough, we must consider that each State has its own "laundry." Just think about Delaware in the USA and the Isle of Man off the UK.
The role of journalists and activists has become crucial. Despite taking personal risks, they are always looking to bring to light international transactions that have enabled corrupt leaders, such as the former Tunisian president Ben Ali and the former Ukrainian president Yanukovych, to hide their treasures abroad before fleeing.
IRPI, Italian centre of investigative reporting, and ANCIR, African network for investigative reporting based in South Africa, are launching a "Mafia in Africa" follow up based on #panamapapers tomorrow on The Namibian and Friday on the Mail&amp;Guardian which will be presented for the first time in this session - with Alessia Cerantola, for the Panamapapers project, Cecilia Anesi for Irpi.
Organised in association with Transparency International Italy.

Turkey ranks in 149th place in the Reporters without Borders World Press Freedom Index, below Zimbabwe and Burma/Myanmar. In its 2014 report, Freedom House demoted Turkish media from being “partly free” to “not free.” Turkey remains the only nation in its European peer group to be so dishonored.

Separating fact from fiction: understanding the most effective tools and techniques for verifying social content.
In this workshop, led by two of First Draft’s verification experts, participants will learn how to check the provenance, date and location of images and videos sourced from the social web. How do you know whether you’re looking at the original? Can you track down someone’s telephone number simply from their social username? How can you find out when a photograph or video was created, rather than simply when it was uploaded? How can you double check that the footage was captured at the location of the news event?
Organised in association with the First Draft News Coalition.

A personal recollection by Lirio Abbate of some of the many Italian journalists killed by the mafia; to honour the testimony they gave against the power and brutality of organised crime, to shed some light on the darkest corners of a country which struggles to remember these heroes. From Sicily to Naples and on up the peninsula to Rome, to the new co-called Mafia Capital which, as any other mafia, wants to silence the journalists who represent a thorn on its side.
Lirio Abbate lives under 24-hour armed police protection following threats to his life as a result of his work as a journalist.

A major new UN study of 121 countries' legal source protection frameworks has found that they are out of date and need strengthening in many cases. It also recommends that ‘acts of journalism’ should be shielded from targeted surveillance and data retention to prevent the exposure of confidential sources.
The study, Protecting Journalism Sources in the Digital Age (UNESCO 2016) includes thematic  studies on practice adaptations within investigative journalism based on interviews with three dozen editors, investigative reporters and legal counsel to media houses, and the development of an assessment tool for measuring the effectiveness legal source protection frameworks globally.
What are the implications of this study’s findings for the future of investigative journalism practice? How should reporters and editors respond? And what can be done to mitigate the risks? The study’s author, Australian journalist and researcher Julie Posetti, will lead a panel discussion featuring international experts and practitioners.
Read a major excerpt from the forthcoming study.

After the economic crisis which began in 2008, the Eurozone tried hard to find cohesion among its members while more and more fault lines opened under it. The accumulated tensions put the single currency project itself at risk. How is Italy located in that scenario? To what extent is the slight economic recovery currently under way the consequence of the Renzi government’s reforms? And to what extent is it the result of positive external shocks, such as the oil price crash or the ECB’s unconventional monetary policy? What are the vulnerabilities of Italy? Is the so-called battle of Renzi against European austerity actually a fight for his own political survival? Does business news in Italy really analyze the facts, or is there a tendency to amplify and simplify, merely reaffirming comforting narratives such as national pride?

In July 2015, the small editorial team of netzpolitik.org was notified that their journalists were under investigation by the German Public Prosecutor General and faced at least two years in prison. The charge: treason. Netzpolitik.org had published two classified documents with budget plans documenting that, two years after the Snowden revelations, the secret service was planning to massively increase its online surveillance capacities.
This was only the second time in Germany's history that journalists were charged with treason.
The publication of a letter of the Public Prosecutor General lead to a massive national and global show of solidarity with netzpolitik.org. Only a few days later, the German prosecutor was sacked and the investigation halted.
This talk gives an overview of the developments, the investigation and wave of solidarity, and it explains the work of netzpolitik.org, the biggest political blog in Germany.

Theopi Skarlatos and Paul Mason on the making of #ThisIsACoup, a four-part 2015 documentary series which examines life under austerity in Greece, the country’s confrontation with the EU, and the emotional turmoil accompanying political change. It is directed by Theopi Skarlatos and produced by Paul Mason for Field of Vision, the visual journalism film unit of The Intercept. Moderated by Leonardo Bianchi.
Paul Mason says of the documentary: "Whatever the beauty of the shots, however brilliantly constructed the narrative is, the mere fact of seeing behind the scenes in this government is such a head fuck. Because no other media have got it. Everybody who is Greek that’s seen rushes or excerpts from this, they tend to clutch at their throat and go, “Wow, I’ve never seen this. I’ve never seen the prime minister’s office. Who knew the chief of staff has a bust of Lenin on his desk?” It’s going to do their heads in, but after it does their heads in, I want them to say, “Well, what happened? What did we learn from that?”
The screening of #ThisIsACoup (total duration 64 minutes) will follow the talk with Theopi and Paul.

Join Robb Montgomery for a photo walk through Perugia and discover firsthand how to start using your smartphone to find, capture and share pictures that tell stories. We will meet (regardless of weather) in the lobby of the Hotel Brufani and set of on a dawn photo expedition after a short briefing. Along the tour, special topics and techniques will be shared in impromptu demonstrations as they unfold before the group. Bring comfortable walking shoes, weather-appropriate clothing, and a fully-charged smartphone.
 
The session will be limited to 25 persons. Photo walkers will get complimentary access to a Smart Film School training course.
The purpose of this photo walk is to produce an immersive experience that can help reporters make photos and video clips that can tell a story. The session start time of 06.00 is not arbitrary. During the festival dates, 06.00 in Perugia is about 40 minutes before sunrise. It will be pre-dawn light at this time and the town will be magical as the light appears. Please note that this session will take place even if the weather is foul; sometimes the photos are better!
Please register in the festival press office in the Hotel Brufani to participate in this workshop.]]></descrizione>

Different cross-border projects in the last few years have made it clear that pan-European data-driven journalism is not only a possibility but can also have impact. We want to present a collaborative manifesto to point out the main principles that European data journalism stands for and guidelines for it to try to follow.
Before the festival, we will send a survey to European data journalists to understand which ideas they would like to see included in a common manifesto. The results will be presented in this session, a step towards producing the first European data journalism manifesto.

In an ideal world, public service media are supposed to deliver a healthy dose of impartial quality journalism (in news and other factual offerings), to inform and stimulate their constituents' contemporary debates, and to foster the cohesion and consensus of the societies they serve.
In the real world, public service media exist today on a vast scale, ranging from precarious, bare-minimum efforts (think Western Balkans), to all-encompassing, lofty full-service providers (think German public broadcasting). Either way, the existing institutions face pressure to adapt to a changing political, technological, and public sphere ecosystem, and their legitimacy keeps being contested.
This panel asks after a compelling, content-related, and audience-centric vision for future public service media: How should they respond to the challenges of the 21st century? How should they deliver added value within a multi-faceted, border-crossing online news environment that might make them seem dispensable (or can they at all)? What kind of journalistic formats will best reach new audiences? What is the role of journalists and journalism in future public service media?
The panelists will not talk about problems, but about their best aspirations for public service media, and give some examples of where the future already exists today.

Every aspect of our private and public daily life is now highly computerized. All world economies use the same basic infrastructure, the same software, hardware and standards, with billions of connected devices. At the same time, cyber-crimes have become one of the most widespread phenomena, alarming governments, citizens and the private sector. Data breaches and computer thefts are growing in all sectors, affecting security and development across the world. Cyber-crimes are no longer restricted to isolated attacks carried out by individuals. In recent years, this type of crime has developed to become a very profitable activity, often at very low risk for criminal organizations. Today’s society, increasingly interconnected, has become a target for the activity for criminals who focus in particular on the financial and business sector.
Cyber-​​attacks involve unforeseeable economic losses, but not only. Victims often suffer reputational damage due to the dissemination of sensitive data (personal and otherwise).
We will see together how the cyber-crime phenomenon has developed, who are the main players and who are their victims, contextualizing the international scene and also talking about those advancements to fight off this criminal phenomenon.
Organized in association with the Department of Legal Informatics of the University of Milan.

The Coral Project is creating open-source tools and resources for publishers of all sizes to build better communities around their journalism. It also collects, supports and shares practices, tools, and studies to improve communities on the web. The Coral Project is a collaboration between the Mozilla Foundation, The New York Times and The Washington Post, and is funded by a grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.
The session will provide an overview of the project's most recent apps (which will be available to any publisher for free), will consider what has been learnt through nearly two years of discussions with publishers, will ask those in attendance to talk about their challenges in managing UGC, and will discuss the project's product roadmap. The results of this discussion would go back to the Coral Project team and would likely influence upcoming product decisions.
The two session speakers, Greg and Marc, are members of the Coral Project team.

In most newsrooms, engagement is still seen as a nice-to-do, but not essential component of day-to-day journalism. We’d like to argue that, increasingly, engagement is journalism. Our work at Experience Engagement surfaced significant tensions between objectivity/independence as traditional journalistic norms and engagement/interdependence as emerging values. From the community side there is a notable tension about trusting journalists to be authentic/reciprocal partners and who holds journalists accountable. This panel will look at engagement as a necessary component of their day-to-day work focusing on connecting with community, building trust, understanding needs, diversifying view points and creating better journalism.

The principles of design thinking and running lean are fairly known in the tech/start-up world but they are rather new in the newsroom. In this session you will not only learn a new way to build news products but also a method to assess stories, a strategy to rethink the journalistic process by involving the audience and a framework for newsroom change.
During the session you will see a lot of examples from VRT Start-up, a news innovation lab at the public broadcaster of the Flemish community in Flanders. Its goal is to put VRT, public broadcaster front and center again in the lives of the people that have grown up with the internet. VRT Start-Up works in a lean/agile way. The secret is to start small and put ideas quickly into simple prototypes. Then we present these prototypes to a target audience and from this method we learn quickly and respond with adjustments on the fly.

While memes and bluster often overwhelm substantive debate, fact-checking has emerged as an important -- and growing -- counterforce. More than 100 fact-checking projects around the world actively hold politicians, public officials and other institutions accountable for what what they say and promise. Other projects debunk hoaxes and dubious claims that infect public debate, often through social media. Many fact-checking efforts are affiliated with media organizations or staffed by people with journalism backgrounds. But other models thrive, too -- including growing communities of non-profit organizations and citizen watchdogs. In this panel, representatives from four top fact-checking ventures will discuss trends, including the ways technology and social media extend their reporting and engage the public in finding and spreading factual information.

How can newsrooms use audience analytics to empower journalism rather than fall victim to a tyranny of metrics? A diverse range of quality news organizations including the Guardian, the BBC, and others are leading the way in the development of distinct forms of "editorial analytics".
These editorially-lead approaches to analytics differ from more generic and rudimentary forms of analytics in being tailored around particular editorial priorities and organizational imperatives; they are built around particular kinds of journalism and particular business models or public service purposes, rather than simply using crude metrics like page views or unique users for short-term optimization.
In this panel, we discuss the development of editorial analytics, why most news organizations are not there yet, and what the journey ahead looks like for audience analytics in newsrooms.

Podcasting reached mainstream popularity in 2014, with the success of the investigative show Serial. But podcasters have been around for ten years, producing audio shows on any imaginable topic (including podcasting itself!) in settings that range from professional radio studios to bedrooms. Now conventional media want to jump in and make their own online-only audio shows.
In this panel we want to explore podcasting as a distinct medium: what are the styles, techniques and challenges? How do podcast networks and platforms work? Is it possible to be a professional podcaster? How do podcasters reach their audience? News, entertainment, investigative journalism, fiction: are they different on a podcast?
In this international talk we will also try to understand what the non-anglophone podcast world can learn from the success of podcasting in the US.

Computerized sensors and electronic interceptions: how they work technically and what are the legal limits for their use, the related national and international framework, draft legislation and main case-law.
In the hot summer of last year, the Hacking Team case became news. Thanks to this attack on the computer systems of the Milan-based company that designed the "Galileo" suite for remote surveillance, public opinion started to become familiar with the concept of "computerized sensors", which until then was confined to a small circle of computer scientists and lawyers. The workshop will cover the technical functioning of these tools and, within their possible application in performing criminal investigations, their eligibility for use (if any) will be explored from a legal point of view. Moreover, the most recent verdicts on the matter will be covered and an attempt will be made to provide an overview on the international regulations in that regard. What are the possible consequences, in journalism circles, of the use of such tools concerning the protection of sources and of the observance of professional secrecy in general? Finally, recent draft laws will be analyzed, draft laws prepared on the basis of an emotional response to the recent terrorist attacks in the heart of Europe – aimed at offering to investigators new and more powerful means of prevention and repression.
Organized in association with the Department of Legal Informatics of the University of Milan.

Traditional news has tended towards highlighting the negative: what has gone wrong and the problems it causes. But is it possible to have tough, critical journalism that also looks for solutions and positive angles on a story? Constructive journalism tries to create positive narrratives and a more healthy debate. But how does it work in practice? And is there a danger that it lacks a cutting edge and independence?
Cathrine Gyldensted describes constructive journalism as follows: "It strengthens coverage in terms of providing a more accurate portrayal of the world; engaging audiences more effectively; and holding power to account by asking them to solve, collaborate, seek a civil debate  - instead of usual conflicts, disagreeing, polarization." See full article for more information.

Digital tools and emerging platforms have empowered newsrooms and communities alike to embrace audience-driven storytelling. What are the new models for collaborative journalism? Do certain stories lend themselves (even demand) a collaborative approach (ie police shootings, migration)? And how do we best measure the outcomes and longterm benefits of in-depth audience engagement?

What are the limits of an aggressive discussion on the web? Has there been an "institutionalization" of hatred that has been spread especially by media, politicians and institutions? What are the differences between online and offline hate, and what are the most effective counter-actions on the net? Are laws which regulate the "spoken" appropriate? Or, in the technological age, is the radical protection of the digital ecosystem more important in order to ensure an uninterrupted flow of thought, without the intervention of politics and government? These, and other current issues, will be discussed in this workshop.

Covering violence and trauma can be a psychologically hazardous enterprise. Journalists working on traumatic assignments often fear that, sooner or later, the work will leave its scars. But few have access to up-to-date information on precisely where those dangers lie and what can be done about them. How can good habits and methods of resilience be developed in order to minimise the risks and, if things do go wrong, to deal with PTSD, burn-out and other possible consequences? How does the exposure to violence, even via the web, affect journalists working on the ground and in the newsroom? The panel will present personal experience, research and solutions of self care techniques in a consideration of the most effective ways of avoiding the negative consequences resulting from a prolonged exposure to risk.

Why do journalism schools teach like it's 1996? And how can we fix this?
In 2016, aspiring journalists need to learn more than traditional reporting skills and journalistic values. They need to master mobile technology, blogging and live video. They need to know how to engage and interact with users on manifold social platforms. They need to learn how to teach themselves the necessary new skills in an ever faster evolving landscape. And they must learn how to create their own (future) jobs as journalistic entrepreneurs.
In the meantime, many journalism schools in the U.S. are evolving and some have become hotbeds of journalistic innovation, while many journalism schools in Europe seem to focus very little on future skills and experimentation. But little changes in priorities and attitudes can have far-reaching consequences.
This panel will focus on how to spark innovation in journalism education, even with low budgets, less than ideal technical equipment and overstuffed curriculums.
Organised in association with the Master Program Digital Journalism at Hamburg Media School.

The war in ex Yugoslavia started twenty-five years ago in 1991. Firstly it was Slovenia to move towards independence and then the Croatian War of Independence contributed to the continued dismantling of Tito's united Yugoslavia. The conflicts in Bosnia and Kosovo in the mid-nineties completed the bloodiest decade in recent European history.
Twenty-five years have passed since the start of the independence conflicts in the 90s and the Balkans still represent the symbol of the most atrocious war on European soil after the Second World War. The Balkans are only a few hours away from Paris, London, Berlin or Rome by air but Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Macedonia are still considered 'strangers' to the European Union. The region still evokes images of Kalashnikovs, mafia and slivovitz fruit brandy, rather than peace and prosperity. Though the dream of the Balkan region was to become part of the common European dream, we are currently witnessing the Balkanization of Europe.
The Balkans represent the heart of Europe, situated at a major crossroads between mainland Europe and the Near East. The identity of the region still represents the point of collision between the former Yugoslav republics. Starting from a period of Ottoman influence, the rule of Christian Orthodoxy to the dominion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, for the Balkans the whole 20th century was marked by war and corruption.
And what about now?
How do the citizens of the former Yugoslavian republics live today? How do they perceive the war in ex Yugoslavia? What do its younger generations aspire to? What about Yugo-nostalgia and Tito? How is the European Union perceived in the moment of the greatest migrant crisis in European history? And above all: what about dialog in the region?
Goodbye Tito, hello chaos! originally is the motto from the project Balkans and Beyond, launched and edited from the European magazine cafebabel.com that unites fourteen young journalists, photographers and video makers from the region who represented  the current political, social and cultural situation across the Balkans through their own lenses. The seven countries were covered: Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Slovenia, Croatia and Macedonia.
Each story was covered by a journalistic partnership, bringing together one writer and one photographer/video-maker. The panel will integrate the presentation of the Balkans and Beyond e-book.

False news stories in the medical and scientific field: how they are set off, how they are propagated and what can be done about it.
The Internet, and social media in particular, is the perfect breeding ground for hoaxes. Several hoaxes, from those concerning the relationship between children’s vaccinations and autism to those promising miraculous cures for pathologies, have recently gained much visibility in Italy. How do hoaxes originate on the web? How are they spread on social media? And how is it possible to stop them? Do institutions and scientific organisations need to work harder to communicate correct information on scientific truth, using even non-conventional channels, which are closer to the average audience? Do we need a sort of counter-information to take place on the web and especially on social media? These are some of the issues to be addressed in this panel.
Organised by the Health Department of the Umbria Regional Council.

What do three politicians - Antonio Tajani, David Maria Sassoli and Silvia Costa - have in common? They are all Members of the European Parliament; in particular, Tajani and Sassoli are the two Italian Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament, and Silvia Costa is the Chair of the European Parliament Committee for Culture and Education. Moreover, they share a common past: they all used to be journalists.
What path led them from journalism to politics? What challenges, opportunities, peculiarities, problems and incompatibilities did they encounter during this transition? Is this a one-way path or it is still possible for them to reconsider their choices?
These aspects will be considered together with other issues connected with the two worlds of journalism and politics – two worlds which are so close and at the same time so far away from each other.
Organised by the European Parliament.

New technologies offer communication tools and news aggregators that are extremely effective for online journalism. Nevertheless, the use of these platforms, and methods related to the revision and dissemination of content on the web, raise sensitive issues in terms of intellectual property. The aim of the talk is to define possibilities and limitations associated with the use of these tools by providing concrete answers to the latest questions concerning digital press reviews, citation of online sources, re-use of content, and new authoritarian rights over curatorship systems.

What is the objective of the people narrating these stories? And on what occasions does the act of bearing witness leave space for empathy and direct action?

Can a robot do my job? Understanding the growing trends in the world of computational journalism.
With the Associated Press, amongst others, using automated journalism techniques to publish many of their finance and sports stories, and machine learning re-writing headlines for Buzzfeed in real-time, we are living the age of computational journalism. This panel brings together a group of world-class researchers examining the key trends of algorithmic accountability, automated journalism, artificial intelligence and the possibility of designing a new programming language for journalists. Hear about their current research projects and listen to a discussion about these cutting-edge trends and what they mean for the future of journalism.
Organised in association with the Tow Center for Digital Journalism.

Messaging apps and Chatapps like Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, Snapchat, Viber, and WeChat are soaring in popularity. This shift means that increasingly, valuable eyewitness media is being shared on these closed networks, away from the social media monitoring technology employed by newsrooms. How significant is this shift, and what are the challenges faced by newsrooms in terms of discovery, verification, and permission requests? And what are the ethics of using content sourced from these spaces when users think they’re sharing with a small number of contacts?
Organised in association with the First Draft News Coalition.

Hunted by ISIS, the Syrian regime, Shabiha, different fighting groups, the Syrian electronic army and corporations, Syrian journalists and citizen reporters face death on a daily basis, and their data frequently gets lost while they report on the revolution. Taking the point of view of a Syrian digital security trainer, the focus of the talk will move from the simple digital perspective to a holistic one. Journalists in Syria and neighbouring countries must confront many challenges in their work, including physical, psycho-social and digital risks. The dangers faced by journalists in a war zone, what the attackers’ goals are, and some defence tactics will all be considered.

Yemen is presented by the Western media as the hideout of al-Qaeda and the kingdom of child brides. But it is also a nation with a millenary culture and youthful creativity, both back in vogue during the 2011 revolution which was the most peaceful among the so-called Arab springs. Yemen is currently being destroyed by a terrible war, largely ignored by the media, despite its centrality, along with Syria and Iraq, to the Middle Eastern crisis. In this war scenario, in which Western countries participate by selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, the Yemeni population has been extremely resilient and local artists have tried to recount the conflict by showing its consequences on civilians and on a unique cultural and architectural heritage.

Over the past few years, The Times and Sunday Times have broken several exclusives that led to international outcry and institutional change, due in part to their investment in a computational investigations team. From uncovering tax avoidance, to doping in athletics, the data team at The Times and Sunday Times changed journalism practice by integrating computing into the story finding process. The team, equipped with statisticians, programmers and journalists, lends an analytical eye to stories in a unique way for a newspaper. They were the only team in the UK to reject the polling data - now widely known for being flawed - ahead of the last General Election. This talk by the team's Data Editor, Megan Lucero, will go behind the scenes of several of their big stories and explain how her small team went from being a supporting unit to a key component of Times and Sunday Times investigations.

Attacks against investigative journalism in Italy don't come (just) from death threats. Intimidatory lawsuits, unjustified seizures, deficient and inadequate laws, unreasonable claims for compensation, the risk of protecting (and the duty to protect) confidential sources and the lack of legal protection for temporary and/or freelance workers have all contributed to making life very difficult for journalists who want to publish sensitive stories.

Clickbait vs mandate: how public service broadcasters can balance journalistic integrity with the pursuit of page views.
Public broadcasters are strapped for cash and under extreme pressure to remain relevant to their audiences. The smart ones are shifting their resources and expertise to online content but many of them are still struggling to find their place.
With competition in the digital world increasingly nimble and aggressive and pushing boundaries, it's important to discuss where public broadcasters fit in. Too much lengthy analysis and nothing gets shared or read. Too many listicles and adorable animals and no one takes you seriously. This presentation explores how to walk the line between what the public may be interested in versus what's actually in the public interest.

Graphing data is one of the core components of data analysis. Visualizing information can help journalists quickly identify trends within a dataset, and a powerful visual can tell a compelling story. In this workshop, we will present the basics of the ggplot2 package in R (an open-source statistical language), including installing the package and using it for plotting, exploring, and transforming data. Attendees will leave with an appreciation for the grammar of graphics and the power of ggplot2 for both exploratory and explanatory purposes.
This workshop would be most helpful for those who have experience working with data.
We recommend attendees of this session install the R package as well as R studio to be prepared for the workshop.

February 2016 was the hottest month on record. Two months earlier world leaders gathered in Paris to hammer out a climate deal just as extreme weather events were causing drought in Southern Africa. All the while, record numbers of migrants continued to arrive in Europe. There are more reasons than ever for media to write about the repercussions of climate change yet a new study being launched at the panel - Climate Change &amp; Migration: The Untold Story - shows it's just not happening. Join in the debate with an international panel of experts and journalists and to learn more about the real issues that hang in the balance.

Italy ranked 65th out of 122 countries in the 2015 Freedom House report on freedom of the press, in the “partially free” category. Threats, intimidations and legal actions brought against journalists contribute to this terrible result: Italy is among the last countries in Europe, 30th out of of 42 countries, just before Hungary. How strong is the censorship climate in Italy? And how much of this process is now so intertwined with the attitude of journalists that it leads them to a form of self-censorship? Has the crisis of trust in journalism as a whole augmented this phenomenon, making it difficult for the media to defend itself against attack?

			<descrizione><![CDATA[
In 2012, Salvatore Iaconesi was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Instead of surrendering to his condition, he decided on a radical gesture: he began to publish online his medical records and all related data, and literally asked for the whole world to participate in his care, to bring his disease back to the human and social dimension lost in hospital protocols. And the whole world responded. From far and wide doctors, researchers, more or less credible healers, designers, artists and ordinary people contributed to a collective experiment of sharing and openness. Thus La Cura was born, a revolutionary open-source project applied to medicine, a personal story told through two voices, a book that could change our point of view about diseases and how to face them, as individuals and as society.

The future of local independent journalism won’t look like its past. And while that is creating unprecedented challenges for newsrooms, it is also opening up new opportunities to reimagine the role of local news in communities. In this session Dan Gillmor and Josh Stearns will discuss how people across country are rebuilding new models of local news from the ground up. They will discuss how community-driven journalism is changing how journalism is produced and used and why collaborations and new journalism networks are becoming increasingly critical to fostering strong and resilient newsrooms. Finally, this session will explore how local newsrooms with small budgets and little free time can test big ideas, experiment and innovate around business models and revenue strategies.
The session will take as its starting point some of the issues raised in the article The future of journalism will not look like its past by Dan Gillmor and Josh Stearns.

Newsrooms adapting to the digital era suddenly have a sometimes overwhelming array of new production processes and options. But they have new helpers too: tech startups focused on helping them discover, qualify, verify and distribute stories. Over the past five years, tools created by these startups have become part and parcel of digital newsrooms.
So how hard is it to build a startup for journalists and editors? This panel will explore the process of building new technology for newsrooms, with contributions from founders of several leading companies.
- Should you start a tech company focused on news?
- What is it like to work with newsrooms and media companies as businesses?
- Myths (do newsrooms pay? Can newsrooms build their own platforms?)
- How can you identify real opportunities and pain points?
- Biggest missed opportunities for newsrooms?
- Intrapreneurs vs entrepreneurs: what advice do founders have.
- How we outsiders view newsrooms (structure, decisions, speed, etc).
- How to improve newsroom and startup relations.

Search engines, social media sites, and messaging apps accounts for a larger and larger share of online news use, presenting news organizations with new opportunities and challenges. The last year has seen a rapid development of the relationship between search engines, social media, and news media, with the increasing importance of referrals and of off-site publishing, including important new initiatives like Facebook Instant Articles, Google AMP, and SnapChat Discover. In this panel, we discuss the evolving relationship between news media and digital intermediaries and what it means for journalism.

Ten years ago, when WikiLeaks was created by Julian Assange, very few people could imagine the revolution unleashed by the publication of documents never seen before, like the Afghan War Logs, or the most recent files on the NSA surveillance of foreign leaders. How far WikiLeaks is willing to go to protect sources has been demonstrated by the Snowden case, when WikiLeaks sent its journalist Sarah Harrison to Hong Kong to assist Snowden to get asylum. As Edward Snowden said: «All of these news organisations around the world, all of these publishers were trying to get a piece of the story. There was only one publisher that actually said: We want to help the source, we want to make sure he’s ok, we want to make sure that, no matter what happens, he has somebody on his side, and that was WikiLeaks.» Can one protect high value sources in an age of mass surveillance? What can journalists and sources learn from the WikiLeaks experience? What can they learn from the cases of Chelsea Manning, Jeremy Hammond, Edward Snowden? What can happen when a journalist does not protect their source? And why are these lessons important for all of us, not only for journalists and publishers?

Unfortunately, the need for crisis reporting abounds. However, for a variety of reasons, many journalists can be no more than spectators, with little opportunity to develop substantial insights into what is really happening. Civil society organisations (CSOs) are increasingly recognising this attention gap and ramping up their own communication efforts, which are often leveraging deep, first-hand knowledge. But can they be trusted? How can CSOs work to gain and keep credibility as independent sources rather than just another party with vested interests? And may activism and journalism ever join forces in the first place?

To be followed at 20.30 by the showing of the documentary film The Internet’s Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz (2014), directed by Brian Knappenberger. Aaron Swartz was a programming prodigy, Reddit co-founder and free information hacktivist who took his own life in January 2013 at the age of 26. The documentary is a dynamic and tragic portrait of the life of a champion of open access who grew up to lead the internet community into a new age of data sharing and free speech.
From the 2014 review in The Verge "The Internet’s Own Boy is a valuable addition to the work done to document the life and times of Aaron Swartz — it’s undoubtedly a touching and personal eulogy to an icon of the internet."

			<descrizione><![CDATA[
Presentation of the latest book of Giovanni Floris entitled La prima regola degli Shardana (Feltrinelli, 2016). Moderated by Andrea Valentini.
In Prantixedda Inferru, in the heart of Ogliastra, it is summer with forty-five degrees in the shade when Raffaele, Giuseppe and Sandro arrive in the village with a very unlikely mission: to revive the local football team and win the Sarda Cup. Problem number one: the corrupt mayor of the town and a millionaire without scruples are energetically against the project. Problem number two: perhaps one of his friends is playing against his own team. Problem number three: what will the first rule of the Shardana be?
In a plot full of twists, Giovanni Floris surprises with a new variation of Italian comedy: the Sardinian comedy. At the center, the four characters: Giuseppe, a journalist tired of interviewing politicians and who dreams of football redemption; Raffaele, a businessman who has lived a single season as a lion and dreams of a comeback; Sandro, the fool in shining armour who dreams of becoming Dario Fo; Michela, the girl with green eyes determined to save her friends from themselves - while dreaming of  Raffaele.
In the background there is Sardinia, beyond every stereotype: a president by chance, a furious knight, an opposed love, a rainbow team, a dispute between Roma and Genovese mafia drug dealers, a world champion on vacation, a lame man on the wing right... and friendship. Friendship that struggles to hold life together, on and off the soccer field.

Join Robb Montgomery for a photo walk through Perugia and discover firsthand how to start using your smartphone to find, capture and share pictures that tell stories. We will meet (regardless of weather) in the lobby of the Hotel Brufani and set of on a dawn photo expedition after a short briefing. Along the tour, special topics and techniques will be shared in impromptu demonstrations as they unfold before the group. Bring comfortable walking shoes, weather-appropriate clothing, and a fully-charged smartphone.
The session will be limited to 25 persons. Photo walkers will get complimentary access to a Smart Film School training course.
The purpose of this photo walk is to produce an immersive experience that can help reporters make photos and video clips that can tell a story. The session start time of 06.00 is not arbitrary. During the festival dates, 06.00 in Perugia is about 40 minutes before sunrise. It will be pre-dawn light at this time and the town will be magical as the light appears. Please note that this session will take place even if the weather is foul; sometimes the photos are better!
Please register in the festival press office in the Hotel Brufani to participate in this workshop.]]></descrizione>

Concepts around economics and business are more complex than ever. At the same time clearly communicating what is happening in the global economies and in business is also more important than ever as well. It is especially important as politics, public policy, business, and society are all inexorably linked and intermingled with economics. This panel will look at different ways of communicating complicated and elaborate international business and economic policies in an approachable, balanced, and clear manner.

We journalists aren't typically natural collaborators. We're competitive and autonomy is critical to our work. Yet, in an era of disrupted business models, scarce resources and new digital possibilities, new models of partnership are emerging. This session focuses on collaborations between multiple journalists and media outlets designed to achieve more ambitious public interest journalism and impact than what a single publication could do alone. We will discuss case studies of recent collaborative projects, challenges of multi-newsroom partnerships and best practices.

Nicaragua and Cuba are two countries where the restrictions to freedom of expression make the work of independent journalists pretty difficult. The campesino’s march to protest against the construction of the Interoceanic Canal in Nicaragua or the recent and historical visit of US President Barack Obama to La Habana are two examples journalists Dánae Vílchez and Ignacio González will try to explain their work through. They will discuss about the ways of avoiding government censorship and the best formats to get to unmotivated and disappointed audiences.
Organised in association with People In Need.

Although the fight against corruption is one of the biggest challenges of all societies, the development of effective strategies to prevent and fight corruption is still very limited. The success of the projects put in place relies on the ability to activate virtuous cooperation mechanisms between institutions and citizens and it cannot be separated from the implementation of effective reporting systems on episodes of corruption, capable of encouraging whistleblowers while protecting their identities as well, activating a flow of data and comprehensive, uniform and useful information.

The Internet of Things is the materialization of what was once called “Ubiquitous Computing” and then “Pervasive Computing”, both seen in the past as positive aspects of technology. Today the naked truth is that all consumer electronic devices are well beyond the full control of their owners; moreover “analogic” familiar things from the past, like cars and TV sets, are now in fact specialized computing devices, doing a lot more that moving passengers or showing film and news, because they are filled with hidden functions. Things are built with millions of lines of code inside, and all this software is supposed to be bug-free and not controlled by entities other than the owner.
The talk will illustrate to what extent the above is completely false, and will give examples of who (and how) uses the Internet of Things and the Cloud against the owners of such devices.

Journalism and Silicon Valley: the changing relationship between the news industry and social platforms.
There is no more intriguing or important commercial relationship in journalism today than the one between Silicon Valley's social media platforms and the field of reporting and publishing the news. The free press was once supported by a pluralistic publishing and broadcasting ecosystem, now the social web is changing this forever. In the last year we saw the rapid engagement of social platforms in taking a more active and editorial role in publishing. The Tow Center for Digital Journalism has been studying these questions in depth. This panel will look at both the practical implications and the theoretical questions of what it means for journalism to become a subset of the social web.
Organised in association with the Tow Center for Digital Journalism.

How to cover an election? We are accustomed to TV marathons, but we are increasingly getting news through online newspapers, live blogs and updates of the results via Twitter. In between, the classic rituals of  election day: higher and lower percentages, live coverage from the general headquarters of political parties, and "if the exit polls are confirmed..."
On the eve of local elections that will take place in all major Italian cities, and with the US presidential campaign under way, we take stock of what has changed (and what has not) in the reporting of the most important moment in any democracy, the election.

The concerns raised by hardware security are increasing more and more as attackers expand their scope outside the pure realm of software. While certainly representing an advanced threat, hardware attacks are often overlooked and protection against them remains difficult while their effectiveness remains high.
The presentation aims to provide an introduction to personal hardware security, outlining the practicality and impact of "evil maid" style attacks where physical access can be obtained. The author’s background in hardware security will be leveraged to illustrate selected experiences gathered from practical penetration testing and security audits, aiming to provide an understanding of involved technologies and countermeasures.

Hackers and journalists: attempts at dialogue and the fundamentals of technology and security. Concepts, terminology, doubts and misunderstandings.
This session includes a detailed overview of the history of hacking, from the 1960s and 70s up to the most sensational events of the modern era: Stuxnet, NSA/Snowden, State-sponsored attacks/Sony, cybercrime/ransomware and more. It will be interesting to learn about the point of view of the original hacker community which, in many cases, has felt "betrayed" by the evolution of certain behaviour and some aspects of the current framework.

We are witnessing a return of nationalisms in Europe. Right-wing movements with radical and populist identity and xenophobic tendencies are now seated in the European Parliament and in 2015 the election results in eight EU countries witnessed growth in their support. While representing mostly a sovereignistic right-wing standpoint, in some cases it includes radical fringes. A journey through six European countries: Marine Le Pen’s France, the United Kingdom of Nigel Farage leader of UKIP, the march of the "new patriots" of Pegida in Germany, the Hungarian far-right parties, the Greece of Alba Dorata and the alliance between Syriza and the Catholic separatists of Anel, not forgetting of course the Italian Lega Nord party of Matteo Salvini, which has declared its opposition to European elites and immigration.

Beyond malware: the nasty side effects of client-side attacks
Should I delete that email? Is this mobile app really useful? These are just a few questions that internet user ask to themselves while the are browsing the internet, opening attachments in the emails they read, clicking on weird links popping up on their mobile device. Web actions may lead to web risks, since anyone could be the target of attackers in a world where even CPU power is relevant for internet attackers. By remote-controlling a device an attacker can forge virtual currency such as Bitcoin or Litecoin, disrupt Internet services, resell user data or take ransom money by encrypting user secrets. Mobile devices are of course subject to the same level of risk as connected computers, with the exception that are also linked to the user’s mobile number and GPS position, which makes them perfect for an attacker to invade a user’s privacy.

In a year when a woman is running for the president of the US, a woman has become the editor of The Guardian, and debates about women in business and in the boardroom are top of mind, have we made any progress on how women are represented in the media? This discussion will take the temperature on where we are now, and, more importantly, will look at concrete solutions of how to make genuine advances across all aspects of the media: getting women’s voices heard on opinion pages and conferences, getting a more balanced view of women being covered in the news, and helping to advance the careers of women in the media.

Journalists, writers and publishers on trial and the limits of the obscene, of blasphemy and of pornography in the pre-digital and digital era.
Trials, kidnappings and censorship targeting journalists, writers and publishers were common in the pre-digital era and even today, in the technological age, they show aspects of great interest. In this session, we will discuss the delicate relationship between journalists, editors and censorship actions or condemnations, with a special focus on some phenomena typical of the Internet and the conveyance of thought on the web.
Organized in association with the Department of Legal Informatics of the University of Milan.

While in the West the crisis in traditional news media is deepening, in Asia the situation is different. In China, despite countless difficulties and regulations, some investigative journalism is being attempted. In Japan, print media is still in a healthy state. But how exactly does a journalist do his job in China? How do they make inquiries in a country that confuses news with propaganda? And in what way does the government try to limit the "liveliness" of some elements of the media? Why in one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world does 92% of the population still read a newspaper? How does Japanese print media manage to maintain such a high demand for its products? Tradition and journalism: stories and solutions from China and Japan.

The increasing prevalence of analytics and Big Data in both the private and public sector present novel challenges for privacy. In this presentation, an example of the concept of predictive privacy harms will be provided. What does it actually mean to predict (individual) behaviour? How do predictive analytics work? And how can predictive analytics turn into predictive privacy harms?
One of the most clichéd examples to illustrate the novel nature of this challenge is the notorious case of the Target pregnancy case. In 2012, the New York Times reported how the retail chain Target uses data mining to predict pregnancies in its female customers - regardless of whether this information has been shared with friends or family. While this example has been exhausted to such an extent that it almost amounts to a cliché, it is nonetheless an interesting starting point to investigate how we talk about and interpret predictive privacy harms in public discourse.

It’s been over two years since the Snowden revelations, and the debate about surveillance, civil liberties, national security and counterterrorism continues. Journalists around the world face impediments to freedom of information, and there are still few legal protections for whistleblowers. What has changed for journalists since the Snowden leaks?
This panel is about the way the leaks have affected the practice of journalism. The panel will coincide with the publication of the book Journalism After Snowden: The Future of the Free Press in the Surveillance State by Columbia University Press in 2016.
As many countries adopt surveillance technology and curtail digital civil liberties, how can journalists continue to function?
Organised in association with the Tow Center for Digital Journalism.

In the last year, we’ve seen a number of breaking news events where content posted by eyewitnesses to social media has become a story in its own right. Whether that’s the hounding of students caught up in the Oregon shooting on Twitter, the lasting impact on those who captured footage during the Charlie Hebdo shootings, or the people who have filmed police violence in the US. In this panel, we will hear the perspectives of those eyewitnesses caught up in these events and will explore how newsrooms should be doing more to protect them. Topics will include best practice for ensuring that someone’s location and identity remains hidden where necessary, protecting individual copyright, and considering the welfare of  eyewitnesses both during a traumatic event and after  they have contributed to your story.
Organised in association with the First Draft News Coalition.

Is red meat bad for your health? What's a triple-blind clinical trial? Are the Finnish really that great at mathematics? What's so significant about statistical significance?
During the first half of this workshop, you'll get acquainted with concepts like confounding, selection bias, Simpson's paradox, randomization and statistical power. In the second half, it's up to you: judge your way through a series of small case studies and practice what you've learned.
It's not enough to say that correlation does not imply causation. Learn exactly what stands in the way of drawing truthful conclusions from data, how to recognize great science and how to spot the flaws that invalidate statistical conclusions.

The question of the role of quality journalism in the digital age and winning strategies for the distribution of video content are the greatest challenges for media companies nowadays. With an over abundance of news content available, what is the "on demand" generation looking for?
As digital video consumption is expanding from mobile and tablets to connected TVs in the living room, how is the traditional TV model going to change the way we consume news? Should journalism or the news consumption experience be reinvented as new platforms emerge in the form of HDMI sticks like Chromecast and streaming boxes such as Amazon Fire TV and the new Apple TV?
We will tackle these questions from the point of view of media companies and Silicon Valley technology startups, comparing both U.S. and European best practices.

For years now, our screens have been dominated by images of migrants and refugees embarking on the perilous journey to Europe, often risking their lives to reach a continent which is increasingly indifferent to their plight. The issue has exacerbated European disunity and raised questions about how Europe should respond to this crisis.
What can TV editors and journalists do to make sure the debate remains centred on facts and not fear? Is it possible to lead the public to a better understanding without becoming part of the political debate? Or is it the precise role of journalists to join and shape that political debate?

The Digital News Initiative (DNI) is a partnership between Google and news publishers in Europe to support high quality journalism through technology, to encourage a more sustainable news ecosystem, to promote innovation in digital journalism. The session will go through the three key pillars that compose the DNI: product development, where a ‘product working group’ will explore product development to increase revenue, traffic and audience engagement; training and research, where Google is investing in new training and developing resources for journalists and newsrooms across Europe with the involvement of the Google News Lab; supporting innovation, where an Innovation Fund has been established to support and stimulate innovation in digital news journalism over the next three years with €150m. The first round of the DNI Fund has been allocated to 128 projects and organizations from 23 European countries for a total of €27m. This session will therefore represent an opportunity to share with the audience some key learnings of this first round of funding.
Organised and sponsored by Google.

A global trend of using ICT for harassing and shutting down female voices and opinions is constantly happening, while women are struggling to stay vocal. The GTI project, apart from networking, sharing and learning, has the main goal to build capacity within the sector (NGOs, journalists) and provide practical solutions and advice to women who use the internet intensively to carry out their activities.
The Gender and Tech Institute Germany collected more than 80 women from around the world with the goal to share and build capacities regarding privacy and digital security. This was the kick-off moment and with all the success that it got the GTI is deepening and now building more institutes with local backgrounds. In a multi-faceted approach the project has directly strengthened people's capacities to firstly improve their own response to restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of opinion and secondly enable them to improve the capacity within their own communities.

Sustainability movements are spreading in a growing number of sectors: food, energy, real estate, to name just a few. Only in journalism the notion of sustainability seems to lack any momentum. We think think it's time for a change and hence piqd wants to spark and support an international slow journalism movement. What is piqd? Piqd is an aggregator for the best information the web has to offer. More than 80 specialist journalists, academics and politicians, covering different topics are recommending content on piqd. Each recommendation is accompanied by a short review, that answers the question "why exactly is this worth the time of the audience?" piqd is considered wants to be a fair partner of a sustainable information ecosystem. We pay our experts and we help quality journalism attract the attention of a mass audience. piqd, currently in German, is starting an international version soon and is looking for english speaking experts from across the globe.

In dealing with the refugee emergency and the terrorist threats of the Islamic State, narratives which center on invasion and a clash of civilizations are unhelpful. In this way, complex historical, economic, religious and geo-political phenomena are subsumed into superficial prejudices that simply spread fear. Yet specific interests are at play and a historic shift is taking place between the West and the Middle East.

Finding and verifying eyewitness photographs and videos to report a news event can be a challenge but if you then want to include them in your reporting then you must also get to grips with the four C’s of using content sourced from the social web - Copyright, Control, Crediting and Cash! Adam Rendle is a specialist in copyright law and works with numerous news organisations to help them navigate these new and often unprecedented legal issues. Jenni Sargent will join Adam to bring in the  fifth C of conversation; sharing advice for how to seek permission to use eyewitness content and ensuring that you ask the right legal questions whilst remaining considerate of the expectations and intentions of the content owner, and mindful of the potential impact on those depicted in the images.
Organised in association with the First Draft News Coalition.

Three years ago just a small bunch of Spanish nerds knew what the data journalism was. Today, the most influential media in Spain all have a data journalism unit and there are at least three masters degrees to study the topic.
What happened? How did data get into the newsrooms of eldiario.es, El Español, El Mundo and El Confidencial, winning international prizes and contributing to global data-driven investigations?
The speakers will explain the current situation (is it a bubble or something really solid?) and the pattern to follow for data journalism in tomorrow's media.

The crisis of the traditional model of parties, the personalisation of politics and ‘strong’ governments have all been ongoing processes in Italy for more than twenty years. The search for consensus and the use of propaganda have been going hand in hand with these transformations, adjusting to the changes in the world of mass media. Which is the role - and what are the responsibilities - of political journalism then? Do reporters from the palaces of power and journalists close to the ins and outs of governments all play the classic role of the Fourth Estate, or are they becoming mere mouthpieces? What about intellectuals? They were remarkably active during the Berlusconi era: are they still playing a major role in the cultural scenario for civic society, or have they adapted to conformism?

In February 2016, BuzzFeed claimed that its comScore metric of about 80 million UVs represented less than one-fifth of its actual global reach. This illustrates a reality that many news organisations are struggling to come to terms with. Media outlets have the potential to reach a much wider audience by distributing their content on social platforms than they could hope to attract to their own properties. How should this inform editorial strategy, and what is the correct balance between pursuing a wider readership offsite, or catering to a loyal audience onsite? The distribution question isn't only one of platforms, but also one of devices. With a rapidly increasing proportion of publishers' traffic coming from mobile and tablet, how should news organisations adapt their output to address this shift in consumption?

The presentation is about the evolution of cars from a technological point of view. Old cars had much technology but no electronic systems. Today’s cars have much technology and are endowed with electronic systems (ABS, GPS, entertainment systems, etc) which criminals may use for criminal purposes. The most important attack and remediation methodologies (standard and best practice) will be described, as well as the likely scenarios where terrorists may use this kind of technology. There is a long way to go before the unresolved issues are faced and dealt with. Discussion is still very much open.

In northern Syria, near the border with Turkey, stands the town of Raqqa, considered the headquarters and capital of the Islamic State. The lack of journalists on the ground, both national and international, kidnappings, crucifixions, beheadings and repression by ISIS had created a curtain of silence around Raqqa, which was impenetrable for the foreign press. Until a group of young journalists and Syrian activists launched a revolutionary information campaign Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS), with the goal to publish and distribute online content in Arabic and English to document the massacre that had been taking place in their city. The members of RBSS live with the constant danger of being discovered. Three of them have already been murdered by ISIS.
Two of the founders of RBSS, Abdalaziz Alhamza and Hussam Eesa, will be in conversation with Francesca Caferri.
For further information about RBSS see the article by David Remnick entitled Telling the Truth about ISIS and Raqqa published in The New Yorker in November 2015.
On 25 November 2015 in New York Abdalaziz Alhamza received on behalf of RBSS the Committee to Protect Journalist's International Press Freedom Award. See the video of his acceptance speech below.

Through a thousand-year journey in poetry, ranging from Homer to William Blake, from Dante to Gozzano, we will discover that poetry and science are not opposed, they were not so at the origin and they are not so today, since they both aim to enhance understanding of the mystery of reality.

These social media companies now hold unprecedented power; over our speech, our data, and increasingly over our access to information and news. What effect does this shift of power have on news consumers and journalists?

Hacking Team, big data and social media: when the news (almost) falls through the cracks.
In Italy, the rules of production and circulation of news follow paths that often seem incomprehensible. This is shown by the case of the attack on the Hacking Team company of Milan, which has had a worldwide impact, but that was almost ignored by the Italian media. The company is a world leader in the "State Trojan" production, ie all software used by law enforcement and government agencies to "infect" and take control of computers and smartphones, for investigation and intelligence purposes.
On 6 July 2015, Hacking Team suffered a devastating attack and most of the company's information assets were distributed on the Internet (emails, chats, even the manuals and the source code). The information made available confirmed doubts that had already emerged as a result of careful studies carried out by the Citizen Media Lab of Toronto and Privacy International with regard to trade relations with countries where human rights are not exactly a priority.
How was the incident described in the news? At the 2015 E-privacy 2015 convention, Renato Gabriele and Manuela Vacca proposed the first social analysis, starting from the big data of Twitter and examining a mass of more than 700 thousand tweets and more than 350 thousand links, to check the actual impact of this news story.
The session will question why the earthquake that struck Hacking Team and was felt throughout the world was little more than just a tremor in Italy. Why have journalists and activists, with a few limited exceptions, not shown any real interest in the news? Are fundamental freedoms, privacy and protection of sources considered optional in Italy?

Mainstream, online news and social media alike have been replete with images of refugees since last summer. Images of people continuously on the move; marching through the countryside (on their way to different European countries), of desperate people at sea on small and dangerous dinghies, of small children both dead and alive, of people crawling through razor wire and trying to board packed trains are all widespread. Images and coverage of moments of intense solidarity with refugees, on the one hand, and of implied links to terrorism on the other, above all in the aftermath of the Paris and Brussels attacks in November 2015 and March 2016, have also been common. One image of a dead Syrian boy, Alan Kurdi, lying face down on a beach in Turkey captured the world’s attention in September 2015. This panel will look at how Twitter played a crucial role in how this image was shared across 20 million screens in the space of 12 hours. It will look at the different ethical dimensions journalists and social media users struggled with when they made choices to share or not share these images and how platforms continue to struggle with graphic and hard to view content. The panel will also extend the discussion to how a key international organisation deals with the visual representation of the refugee crisis as well as their wider social media strategies for dealing with this crisis.
The session will take as its starting point the report published by the Visual Social Media Lab in December 2015 entitled The Iconic Image on Social Media: a Rapid Research Response to the Death of Aylan Kurdi.

Good journalists have never been lazy. They have always been brave enough to experiment with new forms, or to reinvent models of the past. If once this was seen as commendable, it has now become necessary. The competition for readers, viewers or listeners’ attention is so tough that several tools are needed to grasp the spirit of the time and be able to convey the message. From the brevity of Twitter to the iconography of Instagram, from journalistic synthesis - time is money and the most valuable good is information - up to long form journalism and, why not?, theatre. Nothing is forbidden, everything is up to experimentation, much will prove itself to be spot on.

Newspapers and news platforms are increasingly trying to establish a relationship with a young audience through social media: BBC on Instagram, CNN on Snapchat. Twitter and Facebook are becoming channels for instant articles, pursuing readers in their daily social networks. On the other hand, TV, radio and newspapers experience forms of civic journalism that fuel public debate and favour localised identities, building communities of readers and listeners. Pursuing or building reader communities: a transformation concerning formats, languages, distribution logics and business models.

To be a journalist nowadays it is more and more necessary to also know how to be an entrepreneur. This is true, of course, for freelancers but it holds especially true for those who want to set up their own media company. How do you check if a nice idea is also a good business concept? How do you choose which niche to focus on? How do you create a business plan? How many and which variables do you have to consider when thinking about your new company? This workshop has the goal of enabling the participants to find the initial answers and in particular to build their own tools to ask themselves the right questions.

Commercial, political and personal global surveillance and the monitoring of data, information and the life of people have become highly topical themes. Current technologies allow the interception, monitoring and supervision of almost all online activities, both by private citizens and inside commercial entities and critical infrastructures. This workshop will analyse the most common surveillance techniques, both interpersonal (with reference to privacy) and those aimed at industrial and institutional espionage, together with the most common procedures of defence.
Organized in association with the Department of Legal Informatics of the University of Milan.

The Syrian conflict is one of the longest and bloodiest of the Middle East. Nevertheless, there are very few journalists who have managed to document it on the ground. This is why activists who have had the courage to stay have become in the last two years a fundamental source of news on the effects of bombs and attacks on the Syrian population. On the one hand, however, this aspect opens a very sensitive debate about the need to report their testimonies without putting them in danger, and on the other to mix information and data without relying on a single source, thus avoiding creating biased information. It is fundamental for the Western media not to fall into the trap of oversimplification to explain the Syrian conflict as a confrontation between the superpowers and ISIS when the geopolitical scenario is instead one of the most complex in modern history. News coming from the front line is filtered by all involved. This is why a continuous verification of sources and facts is so necessary.

From "megaphone", used solely to promote one's own content, to a concrete publishing project to create new business models and new ways of dialogue with readers and professional communities. Newsletters have been revived, in recent years, by focusing on the reader. Previously considered as an old tool, they are now becoming a specific service of selection and content curation in the era of digital abundance.
In this workshop we will analyze the main recent case histories of news industry newsletters (Daily Brief Quartz, First FT, Stratechery, NextDraft, Good Morning Italia) and consider the issue of how to create and manage one (the example of Wolf., a newsletter for Italian media professionals).

Technical and scientific journalism in the digital age: approaches, objectives, problems.
To write about technological issues becomes, day by day, more and more complex. It is not always easy to describe certain events carefully, ensuring both the accuracy of news and the comprehensibility of complex concepts due to different reasons: the evolution of systems, technologies, the policy and legislative framework and worldwide events. In this workshop, starting from some practical examples, some methods related especially to the world of security, cybercrime and information warfare will be illustrated.
Organized in association with the Department of Legal Informatics of the University of Milan.

To defend our identity. But which identity? The Christian West or the Enlightenment West? Liberal democracy or egalitarian democracy?
Paolo Flores d'Arcais vs Giuliano Ferrara. Two well-known Italian intellectuals - one on the left, the other on the right - will discuss "our identity." They will also refer to the recent book by Flores d'Arcais entitled La guerra del Sacro-terrorismo, laicità e democrazia radicale (The sacred-terrorism war, secularism and radical democracy).
Isis has declared war on the world of civil liberties created from the Enlightenment. Moderate Islam is often invoked to defeat fundamentalism but how many contradictions are there behind this term? According to Flores, to respect the "diversity" of cultures when it implies subjugation of women and clerical obscurantism should not be countenanced because at root it is only a wretched betrayal of our values. Justice and freedom and mass enlightenment are the basis from which to start. For many years, Giuliano Ferrara has been one of the most consistent champions for re-establishing the idea that every political and cultural choice should be based on Christian values and that believers and non-believers alike must follow "sicut Deus daretur," as requested by Pope Ratzinger.

From live debate on light topics to live witness accounts of citizens facing an emergency: how are Italian radio stations taking the opportunities of social networks to involve listeners in content creation. One advantage of web and mobile technologies is that it enables everyone to produce audio content and distribute it to the most interested communities. What and how will the role of web radio and podcasts develop in the Italian media landscape? This will be discussed based on the data provided by the Social Radio Lab and, above all, based on the experiences of those who have lived through this evolution: journalists and radio speakers on FM and web radios.
Organised in association with Social Radio Lab and Spreaker.

Journalists in South East and Central Europe are often filling an institutional gap and doing investigations in cases of corruption instead of state authorities, including investigation of corruption inside the police. Instead of state authorities, journalist examine business practices of oligarchs, find people on wanted lists, investigate questionable deals involving family members of politicians in power, compare the reported salaries with the extravagant lifestyles of managers working in public companies, investigating financial and other irregularities in the churches. Journalists are working on these issues closely with civil society organisations, national authorities and financial institutions, and also international anti-corruption groups. Journalists do it in difficult conditions, and sometimes at great personal risk. Good investigative journalists may expose criminality and help bring criminals to justice, but they are not officers of the law.

This workshop aims to focus attention on the dynamics of action and reaction and related user-generated content (comments, tags, answers), capable of telling points of view on the dynamics of public conversation on social media which do not emerge from conventional analytic systems.
Through the examination of the public APIs of major social media platforms, the construction of complex databases will be reached, followed by the production of interactive dashboards to simplify the information and collect material for analysis and reflection.
The workshop is open to participants with different backgrounds. It does not require special coding skills, and the tools to be used in the workshop will be user friendly and free.

			<descrizione><![CDATA[Screening of the documentary Torn, produced by the UNHCR and directed by Alessandro Gassmann.
"How do you keep alive your own ideas if you are deprived of your house, your country... of everything?" (Nour Shamma, artist, playwright, Syrian refugee). After five years of war, the Syrian crisis is the greatest tragedy of our era. Half of the population has been forced to flee, more than 7 million people are displaced within their own country, while there are 4 million refugees in neighboring countries. Among them Mohammad, Nour, Alaa, Rasha and many other artists who, despite the fact that a return to a peaceful Syria appears distant, show us that life does not stop while waiting to return. The protagonists of Torn, who met in the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan and Beirut, refuse to be seen as victims and offer a new perspective on the resilience of an entire people. The film is a glimpse into the lives of those who, torn from their own land, cling to their roots, aware of the importance of preserving their identity and that of an entire nation through artistic expression.
To be followed at 15.00 by the session Art and journalism in time of war with Alessandro Gassman, Carlotta Sami, Alaa Arsheed and Patrick Kingsley.

LegalLeaks: how to request and obtain information, documents and data from government even without a Freedom of Information Act.
The law on transparency proposed by the Italian government is not (yet) a Freedom of Information Act on the American or English model, but the access rules can be very useful to journalists and citizens. Diritto Di Sapere, in collaboration with Associazione per l'Open Government and Foia4Italy, will explain how to use Italian law to ask for (and get) documents, data and audio-video files from the government in order to support a journalistic investigation.

Eleven per cent of the citizens of Umbria are non-Italian, one of the highest rates of any Italian region. How have these communities been reported by local journalism over the years? Has the local press imposed a narrative or has it been able to communicate effectively with all Umbrian communities, exploring problems, needs, strengths and weaknesses? What are the most common mistakes made when the local media deals with foreigners? These issues and much more will be considered in this session.
Organised by Umbria24.

Greenpeace has hired a team of investigative journalists as part of its plans to make investigation journalism one of three pillars of its environmental campaigning. Maeve McClenaghan, formerly of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, is part of the team. Together with Andrea Purgatori, Greenpeace Italy president and investigative journalist, she will explain how investigative journalism will sit alongside direct action and mobilising public opinion as the organisation’s three core activities. The session will be followed later at 21.00 by the screening of the documentary about how Greenpeace was formed in the 1970s entitled How to Change the World. 
Organised in association with Greenpeace.

The crisis of journalism and the crisis of politics: are they mirror images? Are the reasons pushing citizens away from politics, making them feel they are no longer represented by politics and politicians, the same reasons taking readers away from traditional media? Trust, reliability, authoritativeness, accountability, independence: what is being asked for by citizens and readers, and what is being offered to them?
Moderated by Arianna Ciccone.

			<descrizione><![CDATA[Showing of the award-winning documentary film How to Change the World on the origins and history of Greenpeace. Introduction by Andrea Pinchera, communications director of Greenpeace Italy.
In 1971 a small group of activists set sail from Vancouver, Canada in an old fishing boat. Their mission was to stop Nixon’s atomic test bomb in Amchitka, Alaska. Chronicling this untold story at the birth of the modern environmental movement and with access to dramatic archive footage unseen for over 40 years, the film centres on eco-hero Robert Hunter and his part in the creation of the global organization we now know as Greenpeace.
Alongside a group of like-minded and idealistic young friends in the ‘70s, Hunter would be instrumental in altering the way we look at the world and our place within it. These early pioneers captured their daring and sometimes jaw-dropping actions on film and from this director Jerry Rothwell has made a thrilling, sometimes terrifying film. A prizewinner at the Sundance Film Festival it is one of the must-see documentaries of 2015.
